# Project Details
Test case is built for the below scenarios mentioned in the QA- technical challenge

---The Application---
The product owner gave the developers in your team the following specifications to build an
application:
• The entry page has a header "Weather Checker", and an input x with a Search button;
• The input box should only accept post codes written as A99 9AA or A9 9AA where A is a
letter and 9 is a digit. e.g.:
- W6 0NW should be a valid existing post-code;
- B99 9AA should be a valid non-existing post-code;
- EC1A 1BB should be a non-valid post-code.
• It should handle errors in the following way:
- If the postcode is not found, display a message to the user saying "Postcode not found!";
- If the postcode is not a valid post code, it should say "Postcode not valid.";
• Once submit is pressed, it should render a table with certain weather properties on the left,
and their values on the right. The following criteria should be met:
- The weather properties "Time", "Temperature" and "Humidity" need to be there;
- If a weather property doesn't have a value, it should not appear on the table;
- The current time should display in the format DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm:ss;
The developers created a frontend application in React, with a backend API in node.js as a first
iteration for this.
